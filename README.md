  ## Description 

  Often times in coding you may find yourself making a similar application, but using a new language/program. This application is my foray into the python language by refactoring, an familiar project that used to use node.js, and handlebars as the templating engine. This was replaced with python, and it's associated packages like flask, pymysql, sqlalachemy, and a few others for security and application deployment. This is my first experience using python and I hope to learn much more in a similar hands on example in the near future.
